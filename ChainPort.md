### <a name="_ulv3sdyxn0jq"></a>**Project Overview ðŸ“„**
**Tagline:** ChainPort is the ultimate security-centric cross-chain bridge.

**Project Description:** ChainPort is a security-focused cross-chain bridge that enables the permissionless and instant bridging of assets. Currently live on 30 chains, this project proposes to integrate Polkadot into the ChainPort bridge. This integration will allow for the bi-directional transfer of any token between Polkadot and all other chains supported by ChainPort, including major EVMs and non-EVMs like Cardano.

**Ecosystem Integration:** The integration will connect Polkadot to ChainPort's extensive network of supported blockchains, allowing projects to bridge their tokens into the Polkadot ecosystem and enabling users to transfer assets like stablecoins and blue-chip tokens. This enhances interoperability, brings new assets and users to Polkadot, and provides the Polkadot community with a secure bridge to access liquidity from numerous other ecosystems.

**Team Interest:** The collaboration is mutually beneficial. ChainPort aims to help onboard more users and assets to Polkadot, contributing to its growth. In return, integrating with Polkadot provides ChainPort access to a new wave of builders, projects, and liquidity, furthering the mutual goals of interoperability and scalability in Web3.
### <a name="_ub039uffxv20"></a>**Project Details**
**Technology Overview:**

- **Architecture:** ChainPort operates as a custodial bridge that prioritizes security. It utilizes cold storage token vaults through Fireblocks and Gnosis Safe.
- **Security:** The infrastructure is secured by smart contracts that have undergone multiple third-party audits from reputable firms including Trail of Bits, Certik, and Zokyo.
- **Technology Stack:** While the specific stack for the Polkadot integration is pending technical due diligence, the project is built with a focus on smart contract-level security and support for both EVM and non-EVM chains.

**Prior Work:**

- **Live Product:** ChainPort is a fully operational product, live on 30 different chains.
- **User Interface:** The live application can be viewed at:[ ](https://app.chainport.io/)<https://app.chainport.io/>
- **Metrics:** The platform currently holds a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $180 million and has a user base of 130,000.

**Limitations:**

- The deployment will not include Polkadot-specific features unless explicitly requested.
- The project is currently closed source.
### <a name="_yha77yhskvv6"></a>**Ecosystem Fit**
- **Fit in Ecosystem:** ChainPort will serve as a critical infrastructure piece, a cross-chain bridge connecting Polkadot to over 30 other blockchains. This fosters deep cross-chain connectivity, enabling greater liquidity access for dApps and users within the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Target Audience:** The project targets both existing and new users, including token issuers, dApps, and individuals looking to bridge assets to and from Polkadot.
- **Needs Met:** It addresses the fundamental need for secure, fast, and permissionless interoperability, allowing assets to move freely between Polkadot and other major blockchain networks.
- **Similar Projects:** The Polkadot ecosystem features several bridging solutions, including native options like Snowbridge and Hyperbridge, as well as third-party bridges. ChainPort differentiates itself through its combination of custodian-level security using Fireblocks and Gnosis Safe, support for both EVM and non-EVM chains like Cardano, and a permissionless system for automatic asset whitelisting.

Team's experience:

The ChainPort team has extensive experience in building and maintaining a robust cross-chain bridging protocol. The project is currently live on 30 chains, including non-EVMs, and handles significant value and user traffic, with a TVL of $180M and 130K users. The platform's security has been validated through multiple audits by leading firms like Trail of Bits, CertiK, and Zokyo. The team has also successfully secured grants from numerous other blockchain ecosystems for prior integrations.

Founded in 2017, DcentraLab is the team behind ChainPort. 

Over the years, DcentraLab has launched several innovative Web3 products, including TokensFarm, a cross-chain farm-as-a-service platform designed to enhance liquidity and transparency; Hord, a liquid ETH staking platform that optimizes staking rewards with auto compounding and MEV boosts; and DcentraLab Diligence, a blockchain cybersecurity firm specializing in smart contract audits. Additionally, DcentraLab developed Web3Index, an open data library that maps the blockchain ecosystem, and 2key Network, a smart URL protocol that incentivizes sharing and rewards engagement through smart contracts.

### <a name="_x6lhnj40i321"></a>**Development Status ðŸ“–**
ChainPort is a live and established project, not a new build. The core product is fully developed and operational on 30 chains. This grant application is for the integration of an additional blockchain, Polkadot, into the existing, proven infrastructure. The team has a track record of successful integrations with other chains, many of which were supported by grants.
### <a name="_j1vhud5a3o54"></a>**Development Roadmap ðŸ”©**
**Overview:**

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Less than 6 months, pending technical due diligence.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Not specified.
- **Total Costs:** Not specified.

Milestones:

The development plan is structured in a series of milestones to ensure a phased and secure rollout of Polkadot integration.

- **Milestone 1: Polkadot Testnet Integration.**
- **Milestone 2: Polkadot as Target Chain (Testnet).**
- **Milestone 3: Polkadot as Source Chain (Testnet).**
- **Milestone 4: Exclusion List & Real-Time Threat Detection.**
- **Milestone 5: Mainnet Integration: Polkadot as the Target Chain.**
- **Milestone 6: Mainnet Integration: Polkadot as the Source Chain.**
### <a name="_l7z3iemd0vdt"></a>**Future Plans**
Three months after receiving the grant, ChainPort will have fully integrated Polkadot, enabling seamless bridging to and from the network. Post-grant, the team plans to deepen the collaboration by actively onboarding Polkadot-native projects and providing secure, user-friendly cross-chain infrastructure to help them expand. This long-term commitment aims to drive sustained growth for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. The project's growth will be evaluated based on the number and volume of token bridging transactions.
